    "So far, we've been telling the models what to predict (Supervised Learning). What if we don't have labels? Can the data reveal its own structure? Our firm wants to categorize matches into different 'archetypes' (e.g., 'low-scoring thrillers', 'one-sided high-scoring games') to better understand the game's dynamics. We will use K-Means Clustering to let the data speak for itself."
