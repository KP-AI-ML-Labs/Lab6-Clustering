## 📖 Story Point  
Let the data speak for itself. Can we discover natural groupings or “types” of matches without any labels?

## 🎓 Mapping to Lecture  
- **Topic:** Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)  
- **Python Libraries:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`  
- **Category:** Unsupervised Learning

## 🧪 In-Class Practical  

**Objective:**  
Group matches into archetypes using K-Means clustering.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Create features: `first_innings_score`, `second_innings_score`, `total_wickets`  
2. Use **Elbow Method** to find optimal `k`  
3. Train `KMeans` model with chosen `k`  
4. Visualize clusters in 2D scatter plot  

---

## 🏡 Home Task  
- Analyze cluster centroids  
- Write a brief interpretation for each archetype  

---

## ✅ Deliverable  
Elbow Method plot & scatter plot of clusters.
